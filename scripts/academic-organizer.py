# 1. Project: Student Academic Organizer for XYZ University
# Client: XYZ University

# Project Overview: XYZ University wants to develop an Academic Organizer to help students manage their academic activities. The solution should include functionalities for managing assignments, tracking study hours, recording grades, and keeping a study journal. Each function should be simple to use and integrate seamlessly into the overall system.

# Scenario and Tasks
# 1. Assignment Management

# Scenario: Students often have multiple assignments with various due dates. They need a system to keep track of these assignments efficiently.
# Task: Develop a function that allows students to add assignments with a description, due date, and subject.
# 2. Study Hours Tracking

# Scenario: Students need to monitor the amount of time they spend studying to ensure they are dedicating enough time to each subject.
# Task: Create a function to log study sessions by capturing the subject, duration, and date.
# 3. Grade Recording

# Scenario: Keeping track of grades helps students monitor their academic progress and identify areas for improvement.
# Task: Implement a function to record grades by specifying the subject, type of assessment (e.g., exam, quiz), and the grade received.
# 4. Study Journal Keeping

# Scenario: Reflecting on study habits and strategies can help students improve their learning techniques and manage stress.
# Task: Design a function that allows students to add journal entries by specifying the date and content.
